POLITICS_COL_PUMAREJO_DESC:0 "Alfonso López Pumarejo began his rapid rise in politics in 1915 when he begun working as a journalist for the for one of the biggest liberal newspaper of Colombia and as a local rapresentative in the department where he was born, Tolima. His firm stance against the conservative elite and his noteworthy capacity to make friend with almost anybody quickly gained him the symphaty and the trust of the public and of many senators, giving him the opportunity to be elected for the Chamber of Representatives in 1925. During his time spent as rapresentative in Tolima, in the height of the hegemony period for the Conservative Party, he managed to uncover a scandal in which the then president Marco Fidel Suárez was involved, accusing him throu his articles and showing the evidences, which ended up forcing the president to renounce to his duty. After being designated minister he finally became the head of the party just in time for the presidencial election of 1930, when a fracture inside the opposition party permitted the Liberals to get Enrique Olaya Herrera the job. Then in 1934 he candidated himself and won, becoming the 19th president of Colombia. His first measures where the expansion of the welfare and investments in infrastructures, the founding of new newspapers and most important a reform of the 1886 constitution, finished by December 1935."
POLITICS_COL_MONTEJO_DESC:0 "Eduardo Santos Montejo, son of a popular journalist and politician who died suicide in 1900 when Eduardo was just eighteen, graduated from the 'Facultad de Derecho y Ciencias Políticas de Universidad Nacional de Colombia' in 1908 and began to work as a journalist himself for 'El Tiempo', newspaper that in 1913 he bought and directed with huge success. He then became the director for the successful 1930 presidential election of liberal candidate Enrique Olaya Herrera. This accomplishment granted him the friendship of the Liberal Party leader and future president Alfonso López Pumarejo and a position as minister of Foreign Affair for just a year, then he was moved to become the governor of Santander in 1931 and eventually, when his close friend Pumarejo became president, assigned as a rapresentative to the League of Nations. Finally in late 1935 the president recalled him back to become his head of ministers and his unofficial vice. Despite his many personal achievements many still suggest his moderate positions are representative of his inability to take a firm stance on many issues and don't represent a real democratic alternative to the right-wing coalition."
POLITICS_COL_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "A council of ministers and military personel is provisionally replacing the democratically elected governament with functions of basic administration and security keeping."

POLITICS_COL_PEREZ_DESC:0 "Luis Mariano Ospina Pérez graduated from highschool in 1895 and by 1900, he had graduated the 'Facultad de Derecho y Ciencias Sociales de Buenos Aires' as a Lawyer with a PhD in jurisprudence, accomplishing one of his father's last wishes before he died. Robustiano took over his father's company, 'Patrón Hermanos' and then went on to become involved in Salta's Politics until he was elected governor of the same province between 1913 and 1916 with an independent party. His government in that province was characterized by great political stability and financial balance, and became one of the first provinces to fully embrace the Saenz Peña law.\n\nIn 1932, with the death of Uriburu and the upcoming elections, he formed among other independent leaders the 'Partido Democratico Nacional', where he was chosen as head of the party. Now that Robustiano has managed to achieve presidency, his entrepreneurial spirit, fiscal responsibility and compromise skills will surely usher in a new age of economic prosperity for Argentina."
POLITICS_COL_ACEVEDO_DESC:0 "Efrain Rojas Acevedo became involved in politics with the local socialists of Pompeya's neighbourhood at a very young age, joining the 'Gremio de Empleados de Comercio'('Trade Employees Syndicate') and the Socialist Party as soon as he came of age. Unlike the leadership within the Socialist Party, he liked to keep direct contact with the workers, which gained him a lot of support among the trade unions. Despite having an illustrious performance within the 'CGT' ('Central General del Trabajo'), he never managed to climb up the ranks within the Socialist Party.\n\nAfter Uriburu's coup and the subsequent crackdowns on anarchist, syndicalists and socialists, he was arrested and taken to the Ushuaia penitentiary. Now that he's free and sits within the 'Casa Rosada', He'll use his connections within the Trade Unions to lead Argentina to a better tomorrow with the worker's consent."
POLITICS_COL_GAITAN_DESC:0 "Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Ayala was born in 1885 in the city of London, England. Her father, Armand Mureau, was a member of the French Paris Commune during the 1871 uprising and Her family was forced to move to Argentina in 1890. She met Hipólito Yrigoyen, who was professor of moral and civic instruction in her school, where they kept a friendly relation, with Yrigoyen beggining to inspire the young woman towards political activism. In 1906 she founded the Argentinean Feminist Movement, joining the Socialist Party and later entering the 'Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Buenos Aires' in 1907, where she graduated as a Physician a few years later.\n\nHowever, with the Great War raging on and the anarchist uprisings, her views began to conflict with the more radicalized Baldomeristas in the PS. As the Red Scare ran through the nation, she was forced to go underground until very recently. Always valuing democracy and pacifism, now Mureau has managed to become Head of State, where she is bound to try to take the country towards her vision of a new, equal and peaceful Argentina."
POLITICS_COL_NEL_GOMEZ_DESC:0 "Pedro Nel Gómez Agudelo went to military school at a young age, even managing to serve in the German Army until 1913. He was one of the most active members of the 1930 Uriburu's coup d’état, and was his head of the information service of the general staff until Uriburu's death in 1932. While not a direct member of the GOU, his son is one of the founders, granting him a wide array of military and political contacts that he can use if the situation requires it.\n\nNow that Ramirez has managed to become Head of State, he shall rule Argentina with an iron-fist, trying to enforce the discipline, nationalism and faith in Catholicism he was taught to the Argentinean society at large. However, it remains to be seen if his connections within the GOU are enough to stay in power if he ever manages to deviate from their vision for Argentina..."
POLITICS_COL_VIEIRA_DESC:0 "Gilberto Vieira White joined the 'Union Civica Radical' when he was still in highschool. He was one of the mediators between the workers at the 'Taller Vassena' and the national authorities, where he failed to successfully reach a compromise, which lead to a major crackdown in the events leading up to the dreaded 'Semana Tragica'. His party didn't fare much better, as the increasing authoritarianism of Yrigoyen began splitting the party into the old 'UCR' and the new 'Union Civica Radical Antipersonalista'.\n\nTamborini joined the latter while he was minister of the interior during Marcelo T. de Alvear's presidency. In 1935 he was chosen as national deputy, and his political experience has managed to allow him to get enough support to run for presidency. Now that he's head of state, it falls to him to bring about the reforms that Leandro N. Alem, founder of the 'UCR' back in 1891, had envisioned for Argentina, and end once and for all the corrupt practices that have plagued Argentinean democracy!"
POLITICS_COL_GOMEZ_CASTRO_DESC:0 "Laureano Eleuterio Gómez Castro graduated as physician from the 'Universidad de Buenos Aires' with plenty of experience in surgery thanks to an European internship which lasted until 1897. He was very active in politics from a young age, participating in the 'Revolucion del Parque' in 1890. Afterwards, he founded with his friend, Juan B. Justo, the 'Diario del Pueblo', one of the first socialist newspapers in Argentina. In 1900 he finally decided to affiliate to the 'Partido Socialista' which Justo had helped found, and then both founded the cooperative 'El Hogar Obrero' in 1905.\n\nAfter the death of Juan B. Justo, he became the obvious candidate of the now more moderate Partido Socialista, but didn't manage to win the 1932 national elections. Now that he has managed to become president, he'll strive to turn Argentina away from the exploitative practices of the past and into a better, more egalitarian tomorrow."
POLITICS_COL_PINILLA_DESC:0 "Gustavo Rojas Pinilla finished high school, he began his political career when he assisted Alem in the creation of the Union Civica, and when it subsequently split during the Roca regime, he continued assisting his uncle with the Union Civica Radical. He kept climbing through the ranks of the party until becoming his uncle right-hand man and participating in the 'Revolución del Parque' as one of the main instigators. However, Alem's suicide became a hard hit for the UCR, and an even harder hit for Yrigoyen, who temporarily retired from politics until 1904, working as a teacher in the meantime.\n\nHe then reorganized the UCR in 1904 and managed to get one of his friends, Roque Sáenz Peña, elected as President in 1910, and even becoming President himself from 1916 to 1922. He pushed for progressive reforms and tried to normalize the Argentinean electoral system, even intervening in provinces that were under the control of wealthy elites. He even began granting workers better work laws and began negotiating with many strikers. However, British pressure forced him to begin the crackdowns that lead to the 'Semana Tragica', and the events that subsequently created the FOP.\n\nHis increasing authoritarianism lead to factionalism in the UCR and the subsequent split of the UCRA, and when he was re-elected in 1938, where his antagonizing position against the army and the local elites caused the Uriburu's 1930 coup, where he was banned from politics. Now that he's president again, he'll finish the reforms that he started in 1928 and will try to bring about his uncle's vision of a strong and democratic Argentina."
POLITICS_COL_ARANGO_RAMOS_DESC:0 "Elíseo Arango Ramos, like many other 'Gauchos' from rural areas, was forced to move to the big cities in search of work, more specifically to the city of Zarate in 1923. His first political experience was in 1927, when he signed up with the 'Sindicato de Frigorificos de Zarate', where he helped create the 'Federación Obreros de la Industria de la Carne' with other trade unions of Zarate and Berisso.\n\nWhen Uriburu came to power, he was sent to the Ushuaia penitentiary after organizing a successful strike where he demanded the company 'River Plate de Zarate' to pay their worker's wages which had been delayed for two months. Now that he's free and in control of Argentina, he'll make sure to provide justice for the workers from the exploitation of the bourgeoisie."

POLITICS_ARTURO_FRONDIZI_DESC:0 "Arturo Frondizi was a strong supporter of the UCR and a defender of democracy when Yrigoyen managed to win the presidency, but refused to participate in any sort of political activity. However, Uriburu's coup forced him to change his point of view regarding democracy, where he even refused attending his own graduation ceremony which Uriburu would attend to give him an Honor Diploma in Law.\n\nHe was arrested in a democratic demonstration in 1931. This very detention has made Frondizi decide to leave his work as a law professor and begin a career as a politician. At the end of 1932, he was arrested at another rally, and when he was released he joined the UCR.\n\nHe has since then joined a faction within the UCR that considers the approach of Marcelo T. de Alvear to be too conservative, and he has made promises to bring more progressive reforms to Argentina and return to the economic policies Yrigoyen enacted. Now that he sits in the 'Casa Rosada', it remains to be seen if he'll be true to his word."
POLITICS_RICARDO_BALBIN_DESC:0 "In 1922, when he became 18, Ricardo Balbín joined the UCR and moves to La Plata, where local political activism drove him to sign up in the 'Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad Nacional de La Plata', where he graduated as a lawyer in 1927, but hardly ever using his title as he has since then fully committed to his political career.\n\nHe was chosen as provincial deputy in 1932 and 1940, however, he resigned his last post in condemnation to the fraud that plagued local elections. He has since then left the UCR and joined the more moderate 'Partido Democrata Nacional', where he has promised to bring an end to the corruption that plagues Argentinean society and finally usher in a new era of prosperity."
POLITICS_ROBERTO_ORTIZ_DESC:0 "Roberto Marcelino Ortiz signed up into the 'Universidad de Buenos Aires' to study medicine, but he was forced to change his career to Law due to a strike from the student's centre which caused the medicine section to be closed down temporarily. He affiliated the UCR and participated in the failed 1905 revolution. When the UCR split, he joined the UCRA and became public works minister for Marcelo T. de Alvear.\n\nDespite his support for the democratic process, he supported Uriburu's coup, although he despised Uriburu's economic policies. After the Carlés coup, Ortiz has become convinced that the political corruption in Argentina has to end once and for all if democracy is ever to survive in Argentina, and will endeavour all of his efforts from the 'Casa Rosada' to strengthen the democratic process and end local corruption, with intervention if needed."
POLITICS_EDELMIRO_FARRELL_DESC:0 "Born to an Irish migrant family, Edelmiro Julian Farrel enrolled in a military school and graduated in 1907. While no one doubts of his military ability and personal charisma, he was never prepared to be a politician. Now that the role of presidency has been thrusted upon him after overthrowing Ramirez, he has become a mere puppet of the GOU's control over the country. He relies mostly on his vice-president, Juan Domingo Peron, to do most of the political work, where Farrel only ever appears in public ceremonies and signs public documents in the name of the GOU."
POLITICS_MARCELO_ALVEAR_DESC:0 "Alvear became involved in politics at a young age, helping organize a meeting in Jardin Florida which would lead to the 'Revolución del Parque', after which he became secretary for Leandro N. Alem. He continued serving Alem until his suicide, after which he left to France for a time and got married. He was elected deputy between 1912 and 1916 without even residing in the country, forcing him to return to Argentina during the Sáenz Peña regime, after which he became Argentinean ambassador to France, even donating a large amount of wealth for the construction of front line hospitals.\n\nHe was elected as president from 1922 to 1928, where he tried to reduce the FOP's influence in Argentina at large by granting better rights for workers in the country, although he had kept a hardline stance towards the FOP, mostly due to militaristic influences in his staff. Like his predecessor, Yrigoyen, he tried to intervene provinces that had their elections rigged by wealthy local elites, but his methods polarized the UCR and the UCRA even more. Nevertheless, his progressive social, educational and economic reforms have left a positive impression in the Argentinean people, and now that he's been re-elected as president, he'll try to re-enact and continue the reforms for which he stood for in his first presidency."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_DE_ANDREA_DESC:0 "Miguel de Andrea began his career after being ordained in 1899 by the Bishop of La Plata, Juan Terrero. He climbed steadily the ranks of the church until becoming the Head Priest of the San Miguel de Arcangel Church, and being named director of a Social-Christian Trade Union, the Circulos Obreros Catolicos, after the death of its founder, Federico Grote. However, unlike his founder, Miguel de Andrea took a hardline stance against the rising anarchist movements growing in the city of Buenos Aires, and as such quickly found himself aligning with the Liga Patriotica, taking part in their rallies and putting them into contact with the most reactionary sectors of the Argentinean branch of the Catholic Church.\n\nHowever, his views never aligned with the league, and he found himself coinciding more with the Portuguese Integralists who catered to his anti-liberal, ultra-catholic and Corporatist mindset. While originally skeptic of a Brazilian victory, he quickly abandoned the Liga Patriotica as the defeat seemed imminent, and began pushing his contacts in the Brazilian church in order to proclaim his loyalty to the Integralists. Without any solid military or civilian leaders willing to obey Brazilian commands, Miguel was chosen as the provisional President of Argentina until a more stable government can be settled in favour of the Integralist doctrine, which Miguel believes will finally bring faith in God, the Church and the government back to the workers."

### Ideas ###
COL_political_turmoil:0 "Political Turmoil"
COL_political_turmoil_desc:0 "In a country where the two party system always represented the norm, the recent insurgence of minor parties, lead by ex members of the Liberal and Conservative party, had the effect of moving the political discurse to the extremes. Frequent episodes of violence emerged in all of Colombia, expecially in the most far zones from the capital and where the state grip is less present. Many political analysts predict that at this rate we will have serious trouble to deal with in the next years, when violence will become the norm."
COL_black:0 "Black Monday"
COL_black_desc:0 "Black Monday had very harsh effect on Colombia economy, a large part of the population suddently became jobless and lost their livelihood. Massive changes will be necessary to stop this and put the country back on his feet!"

COL_bogotazo_2:0 "Bogotazo"
COL_bogotazo_2_desc:0 "In the awful climate of violence and destruction perpetrated by both sides of the political spectrum the president decided to take side and doing so made the problem even worse. Even if not yet declared Colombia is now on the verge of a civil war, where even the people that usually sided with the moderates are ready to take action themselves to assure the complete annhilation of all opposition."

COL_reform_mil_academies:0 "Reformed Military Academies"
COL_reform_mil_academies_desc:0 "As for Field Marshall Pinilla and others high ranking army leaders demand, the reformation of military academies is intended to assure the loyalty of the cadects and eliminate any risk of having soldiers secretly siding with the socialists. This of course will come to the expense of training time without assuring any real short term benefit to preparation of the academies' attendants."

### Events ###
col.1.t:0 "Colombia's Place in the World"
col.1.d:0 "Weakened by numerous civil wars (especially 1899 - 1903), the Colombian government led by Tomás Herrán was forced to acknowledge U.S. control of the Panama Canal in the Hay–Herrán Treaty of 1903. However, despite Herrán and the American government’s brokered treaty, the Colombian Congress refused to ratify the treaty. The United States in retaliation then forced the secession of Panamá from Colombia, “compensating them” with $25 million dollars paid out from 1921 to 1930. Following the end of the civil war, the conservatives took power and pursued the modernisation of the country, expanding the railroad network. Since 1850, Colombia’s main export had been tobacco, but with the turn of the century, it began to export coffee, bananas and petroleum with the aid of U.S. capital. Despite the economic growth, conflicts within the two major parties and their supporters never faded away and with the growing number of strikes and unrest, in 1928 the conservative government massacred a group of banana workers near Santa Marta. Estimates of the number of deaths ranged from 47 to as high as 2000. Public outcry ensued and the electorate was further divided. The liberals formed a government in 1930 which enacted various social and economic reforms with benefits for the various social strata. In 1933, a dispute over territory in the Amazon rainforest caused a short-lived war between Colombia and Peru which ended inconclusively"
col.1.a:0 "Whatever the future holds, we stand united."
col.29.t:0 "Black Monday is a disaster for the Colombian economy"
col.29.d:0 "With the sudden crash of the German stock market, many states including Colombia are sailing through troubled waters. Many economists predict that without rapid industrialization and a sudden shift in economic policy, the future for the Colombian people could become desperate. Many foreign investors are already fleeing the country. The world steps closer to the verge of collapse"
col.29.a:0 "We should pray for Colombia's salvation."
col.30.t:0 "Violence erupts!"
col.30.d:0 "The political discussion between Colombia’s left and right wing parties has been a staple of our country for a long time. Recently, with the devastating and inevitable crash of the Berlin Stock Exchange, the economic crisis that ensued and shook our country left our citizens enraged and in despair. More and more people are starting to feel like the Liberals and Conservatives are not representative of their interests. Many on both sides have launched attacks on the publications supporting the opposing side, setting buildings on fire and brutally killing others in their homes. This new wave of violence is currently confined to the coastal cities, but soon it could spread to our capital and other major cities in the interior. Meanwhile, although the army has been deployed to maintain order, certain elements within the army are also fanning the flames of hate against UNIR voters. People's militias are starting to organize in the countryside and in the Chocó department, where the government’s control is weakest, proclaiming their need for self-defence. Some of them are even calling for a nationwide revolution, which could result in a large-scale civil war.\nThe situation is getting increasingly desperate with every hour that passes. Should our government take a side in this matter or should we, as many of our citizens suggest, call for an early election to let the people decide?"

An enraged mob of people sympathetic to Gaitán pursued the shooter and killed him. His body disappeared and along with it, his identity and motive remain unknown. Many believe that the shooter was secretly coordinated by members of the military sympathetic to the Chulavitas movement.\nThis incident has led to massive disorder and renewed fighting in the streets. Buses have been set on fire, shops looted and destroyed, and police vehicles stolen. Chaos is everywhere. News of the assassination attempt has also begun to reach Medellin where the violence is just as serious and the situation as precocious.

col.25.t:0 "UNIR protests military actions with the Silent March"
col.25.d:0 "UNIR's leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán organized, along with support from the Syndicalist and Totalist factions, what has now been dubbed the “Silent March” across Bogotà. Approximately 100000 people, including supporters of the militias and more moderate liberals, are participating alongside the organizers, utilizing absolute silence from all of the demonstrators to denounce the recent episodes of violence that have shaken the country. Gaitán has used the march to call for an end to the government’s use of the police and military forces to repress political opposition, and invites us to confront the UNIR in a more civil and constitutional manner. Although today’s protest has thus far proceeded without incident, another protest is already scheduled for next Sunday in Manizales, with another in Bucaramanga in the works.\nDespite the current peaceful veneer Gaitán is trying to lend the protests, officials in the army are worried that the militias might eventually take them over, and that the country's security might continue to slip if left unchecked. The army is now requesting authorization to utilize force to disperse the protestors if they don’t comply with orders."
col.25.a:0 "We need to disperse the protests. Send in the army!"
col.25.b:0 "Their points are fair, we should avoid unnecessary military intervention."
col.26.t:0 "Attempted Golpe fails"
col.26.d:0 "An attempted Coup following the recent Black Monday violence has failed. The military forces, at first coordinating under the unified intent of overthrowing the liberal government, disagreed on who should end up in power, dividing their ranks. Laureano Gomez, at first designated by the plotters to be the new president, was judged too soft by the highest ranking hardline military officials. After a few small confrontations between the army and the ever growing people’s militias in Medellín and Barranquilla, just when the golpe de estado in Bogotá was about to start, the whole ordeal was called off. Soldiers began positioning themselves, raising alarms among the public of what was happening, then, suddenly, the streets have gone silent once again. Many are blaming our army’s lack of discipline and organisation for the coup’s failure. The militias are calling for immediate action to be taken against the military leaders, in order to prevent another coup attempt from causing further chaos, but more moderate factions are calling for a dialogue to be opened with Laureano. Although he was passed over by the coup leaders, some believe he could convince the military extremists to avoid possible bloodshed."
col.26.a:0 "We need to intervene immediately! Use the syndicalist militias."
col.26.b:0 "Their points are fair. We should dialogue with Laureano and the army leaders."
col.28.t:0 "The Radical Socialists Demands"
col.28.d:0 "Our security minister, Tulio Enrique Tascón Quintero, brought us the list of UNIR demands. They ask us to once and for all deal with a number of issues that have been plaguing our nation including: tackling systemic corruption and the ability for parties to essentially purchase elections, the use of child labour, and high poverty rates. They also demand the immediate nomination of the planned economy proponent Esteban Jaramillo as economy minister and a further expansion of our welfare policies starting with the creation of new public transportation systems in the capital. The letter concluded with the signature: \"Sincerely, THE PEOPLE OF COLOMBIA\". A separate meeting to hear the demands of the other minor forces of their coalition, the Totalists and the Syndicalists, has been scheduled for next week.\n\nIn the midst of this back and forth, in Antioquia this morning coffee plantation workers began to strike. Because of the recent events, some locals are worried about the threat of a collaboration between armed Chulavita activists and policemen willing to operate outside normal measures in order to take the law into their own hands, which would likely result in a massacre similar to the one which occurred in 1928 with the bananeras. Tensions are still high throughout the country."
col.28.a:0 "We will implement some of their naive utopian requests to appease them."
col.28.b:0 "These requests are ridiculous! We should refuse."
col.27.t:0 "The Totalist and Syndicalist Demands"
col.27.d:0 "Following some delays in our meeting with the other minor parties of the left coalition, Gilberto Vieira this morning stormed the offices of El Heraldo newspaper accompanied by a large group of his Totalist followers and certain hardline Syndicalists, demanding that the newspaper print a list of their proposed solutions to our country’s problems for the whole of Colombia and even the world to see unless the government responds to their ultimatum. The text opens with an accusation of ineptitude by our government, due to our inability to settle the situation still ongoing in Antioquia which would \“easily be resolved\" by simply accepting the demands of strikers and by answering their plea for better security in the workplace and improved working conditions. What follows is a long list of claims and grievances separated by demands coming from each faction. Chief among the claims are the Totalist's request to arm the party for self defense and the Syndicalist’s request to instruct our foreign affairs to begin forming a closer bond with the Commune of France and all other member of the Internationale Congress. The cabinet suggests responding immediately to Vieira to avoid the publication of this potentially very dangerous paper which could recruit more followers to their cause."

This news did not come unexpected, as we were already informed by their syndicalist party leader Pedro Nel Gómez about the possibility of such a proposal as a form of appeasement from the Social Democrat government of President Alfonso Pumarejo, in response to recent protests sweeping the country. Nel Gómez had already stated his intention to form a closer relation with members of the Internationale and with all revolutionary countries, including ours, as a first step to an official alliance when the unions of Colombia will be strong enough to ‘expel all capitalist pigs’ and ‘bring peace to the working class people’. \n\nThe proposal concluded stating that this could be the start of a long and fruitful friendship between our great nations.

col.34.d:0 "Our security minister, Tulio Enrique Tascón Quintero, brought us the list of Los Chulavitas demands. They ask us to immediately start working on a reform plan for our constitution, limiting majoritarian democracy that they suggest is subverting the political order and making the government powerless, demanding instead a 'mixed' system democracy, with a combination of corporate and popular rule. Accepting this change would mean members of congress will be elected through two different means: either direct popular election or as representatives of various corportate groups such as business and industrialists associations. As a second cornerstone reform he proposes to make public education Catholic and vastly reduce the secular institutions, constitutionally guaranteeing the Church sovereignty and dominance. A separate meeting to hear the demands of the other minor forces of their coalition, the Movimiento de Acción Nacional and Los Leopardos, has been scheduled for next week.\n\nIn the midst of this back and forth, in Antioquia this morning coffee plantation workers began to strike. Because of the recent events, some locals are worried about the threat of a collaboration between armed Chulavita activists and policemen willing to operate outside normal measures in order to take the law into their own hands, which would likely result in a massacre similar to the one which occurred in 1928 with the bananeras. Tensions are still high throughout the country."

They have set up a fake gravestone in front the the main gate with the engraving 'Here lies our dear Colombia, 1819 - [GetYear]'. People started gathering as Pinilla began to read his ultimatum to our government. He then invited Leopardos head ideologue Elíseo Arango Ramos, who was near him the whole time, to come forward and publicly shake hand with him. Later a written and signed form of the ultimatum arrived to us. On it the demands for the institution of an special military Emergency Force designated excusevly to deal with the socialist threat, the reformation of military academies in order to assure discipline and moral rigor within their ranks and the nomination of Carlos Cortes Vargas as security minister. This last point is maybe the most concerning one, since Vargas became infamous for having been indicated as the principal responsable in the Bananeras Massacre and his return in politics would certanly be seen as a provocation by the strikers of Antioquia, in a very delicate moment like this it could mean fueling the rage and making the protesters more violent."

This morning, Gaitán came into the presidential office and along with other party leaders we started discussing the details of the proposed political merger. He proclaimed that many within the Liberal Party would be vehemently in favor of his comeback and that both parties' political programs were compatible and that united, the parties stood a better chance of winning the upcoming election than if they were to remain separate. With the president’s second mandate reaching its natural end without the constitutional possibility of a third term and with no obvious popular candidate to replace Alfonso López Pumarejo, working with our former competitor now seems the most logical path to have a popular figurehead operating within the party’s umbrella to ensure victory for the party. Gaitán established a large cult of personality around himself, and the naming of him as our candidate would lead to winning back those among his supporters who supported the man more so than any of his political beliefs."

As it turns out, Gaitán and the Liberals have been in contact for quite a while discussing in secret the possibility of forming a united opposition, in order to increase the likelihood of winning the upcoming elections. After much negotiation, the two finally reached an agreement assuring the candidacy of Gaitán as a member of the liberal party for the elections of 1946. This will of course mark the end of UNIR and while most of their supporters are expected to simply follow Gaitán, it is believed that hardliners will probably side with the Totalists led by Gilberto Vieira."

In preparation of the upcoming 1946 elections, the members of the party held a vote to designate the party’s candidate for the presidency. Various aspirants from within the party nominated themselves for the job and espoused their vision on how to win the election and what they would accomplish as leader. In the smoky backroom discussions that unfolded as the conference went on, a consensus began emerging around party leaders that a new face should represent the Conservative Party. After some political maneuvering and a round of voting, the majority nominated colonel Efraín Rojas Acevedo, a retired Air Force commander, to be the new party leader and presidential candidate. Most felt that Acevedo's ties to a minor military branch could be seen by the electorate as a moderate alternative to the pro-army stance of Laureano Gómez Castro, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla and Elíseo Arango Ramos, while still satisfying the \"law and order\" and anti-syndicalist sentiments which resonated through the party."

The move was coordinated along with other party leaders, who decided to put their trust behind Ospina Pérez’s choice, colonel Efraín Rojas Acevedo, a retired Air Force commander.
