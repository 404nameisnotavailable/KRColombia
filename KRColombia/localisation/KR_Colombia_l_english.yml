POLITICS_COL_PUMAREJO_DESC:0 "Alfonso López Pumarejo began his rapid rise in politics in 1915, working as a journalist for one of the biggest liberal newspapers of Colombia and as a local representative in the department where he was born, Tolima. His firm stance against the conservative elite and his noteworthy ability to make friends with almost anybody quickly gained him the sympathy and the trust of the public and of many fellow politicians, leading to his election to the Chamber of Representatives in 1925. During his time as representative for Tolima, at the height of the Conservative Party’s hegemony, he managed to uncover a scandal in which the then president Marco Fidel Suárez was involved, exposing the president’s connection to corruption schemes through articles which eventually forced the Suárez to resign. After being designated minister, Pumarejo finally became the head of the party just in time for the presidential election of 1930, when a schism inside the opposition party set the stage for the Liberals to get Enrique Olaya Herrera the job. Following Herrera’s term, In 1934 Pumarejo nominated himself and won, becoming the 19th president of Colombia. His first presidential measures were the expansion of welfare, investments in infrastructure and a reform of the 1886 constitution."
POLITICS_COL_MONTEJO_DESC:0 "Eduardo Santos Montejo graduated from the 'Facultad de Derecho y Ciencias Políticas de Universidad Nacional de Colombia', Colombia’s most prestigious law school. In 1908 and began to work as a journalist for 'El Tiempo', a newspaper that in 1913 he bought out and directed with huge success. He then became the campaign manager for the successful 1930 presidential election of liberal candidate Enrique Olaya Herrera. This accomplishment granted him the friendship of the Liberal Party leader and future president Alfonso López Pumarejo and a position as minister of Foreign Affairs for one year, before being moved to the position of governor of Santander in 1931 and eventually, when his close friend Pumarejo became president, being assigned as the ambassador to Venezuela. Most recently, in late 1935, the president recalled him from Venezuela to become the head of his council of ministers and his unofficial vice president. Despite his many personal achievements, his critics still suggest his moderate positions are representative of his inability to take a firm stance on important issues and his rise to power wouldn't represent a real democratic alternative to the right-wing coalition."
POLITICS_COL_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "A council of ministers and military personnel which is provisionally replacing the democratically elected government and carrying out the regular functions of administration and security keeping until the president can return to his duties."
POLITICS_COL_PEREZ_DESC:0 "Luis Mariano Ospina Pérez's parents were both members of the traditional Colombian political families. His grandfather was president of Colombia between 1857 and 1861. Mariano graduated from the 'Escuela de Minas de Antioquia' as a Mining Engineer and began traveling abroad for two years taking courses on gold mining, sugar cane production, economics, labor relations and cooperativism. Upon his return in 1914, Ospina contacted the leadership of the Conservative Party and was nominated to run for the office of counselor to the City Council of Medellín. He was elected and eventually ran again, successfully, in 1917. Luck was on his side in 1922 when his uncle Pedro Nel Ospina was elected president and helped him become senator for a four-year term. Then, in 1926 he got appointed as Minister of Public Works but only remained in office for eight months, until 1927. That year, Ospina became the first president and the first registered member of the Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia. Because of his high profile and connections within business circles, he eventually managed to become the official candidate for the presidency of the Conservative Party. Strongly believing in God and Christian values but also in the importance of democracy he is seen as a more moderate candidate compared to the ex-conservative senator Laureano Gómez Castro."
POLITICS_COL_ACEVEDO_DESC:0 "Efrain Rojas Acevedo entered the Cadets Military School with the rank of Second Lieutenant on February 22, 1902. During his military career he worked as Military Aviation Section Chief in the War Ministry, Superior Commandant of the Air Forces in Amazonas during the conflict with Peru, military attaché in Brazil, Army Second Brigade Commandant, Military Forces General Inspector and as the War Ministry’s General Secretary. He began to take an interest in politics following the split in the leadership of the Conservative Party, when Laureano Gómez Castro abandoned the party and formed the Chulavita movement. Rapidly gaining the trust of many ex-officials and business personalities as a staunch moderate and traditionalist inside the military apparatus, he became from 1938 on a prime candidate to replace Mariano Ospina Pérez. Acevedo himself assured that he would accept the role and leave his military career, in the hopes of assuring peace and open dialogue with the opposition. He, in fact, strongly believes that a 'non aggression pact' with both revolutionaries and reactionary elements is not only possible but should also be the government’s first priority in the short term. However, many highly respected officials, including Pinilla, openly call him 'a traitor' for his open desire to negotiate with the socialists."
POLITICS_COL_GAITAN_DESC:0 "Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Ayala was born and spent his early years in a poor neighborhood in the center of Bogotá called Egipto where he was exposed to rampant poverty and violence. Although he was raised under such an unfortunate environment, his parents were white-collar workers and held rank-and-file positions in the Liberal Party. His interest in politics sparked during his high school years after he sent a letter to the newspaper ‘El Tiempo’ advocating for education reform which would teach the disadvantaged populace subjects outside of traditional curricula, including topics such as hygiene. Gaitán eventually enrolled in the National University in Bogotá studying law where he founded the University Center of Cultural Propaganda which organized a massive protest movement against president Marco Fidel Suárez. This caught the interest of many within the Liberal Party, who invited him to join them. He further increased his nationwide popularity supporting the banana workers' strike in Magdalena in 1928. When strikers were fired upon by the army on the orders of the United Fruit Company, resulting in numerous deaths, Gaitán used his skills as a lawyer in order to defend workers' rights and called for accountability to those involved in the massacre. In 1933, he created the 'Unión Nacional Izquierdista Revolucionaria', or UNIR, as his own dissident political movement after breaking with the Liberal Party. It is said that Gaitán's main political asset is his profound and vibrant oratory skills that makes him arguably Colombia's most influential political figure of our time."
POLITICS_COL_NEL_GOMEZ_DESC:0 "Pedro Nel Gómez Agudelo started the Colombian Muralist Movement alongside fellow painter Santiago Martinez Delgado. Their art drew on nationalistic, social and political themes as their primary subjects. He studied art in the Socialist Republic of Italy in 1925 where he met his future wife Giuliana Scalaberni who introduced him to the italian syndicalist leaders Palmiro Togliatti and Antonio Gramsci. He then briefly joined the Unione Sindacalista during this time and started to embrace the political views of european syndicalists. In 1931, Gómez Agudelo returned home and started painting the hundreds of murals that made him famous, while, in the meantime, founding the 'Partido Síndicalista Colombiano,' a new political movement with strong ties to his mentors' ideas on unions and internationalism. In interviews, Gómez Agudelo frequently mentioned that his dream is to bring Colombia to the Internationale."
POLITICS_COL_VIEIRA_DESC:0 "Gilberto Vieira White joined the 'Partido Totalista Colombiano' in 1930 when the party was only a few months old, where he built a reputation as the most inflexible maximalist in the country's political landscape. In 1933, Vieira White brought order to the disorganized PTC, establishing a number of cadres which implemented a system of directors running operations over the masses. This new level of organization brought electoral success to the party and the next year Vieira White was elected to the House of Representatives for Cundinamarca. With the support and finance of the party, he later founded two totalist-led newspapers named 'VOZ Proletaria' and 'Diario Popular'. He assumed leadership of the PTC in 1935 following a very agitated party congress in Bucaramanga where the then secretary-general Augusto Durán handed in his resignation only a year after his nomination to the position. His resignation came after the majority of party militants issued calls denouncing him for his stances on judaism, his backwards views of people of african descent and alleged sympathies for social democracy, which branded Durán as siding with the liberals and a 'class traitor'. Following Durán’s resignation and the ensuing power vacuum that formed, Vieira White launched a massive campaign to reshape the party in his image and ideals, adopting many of Oswald Mosely and Benito Mussolini’s ideas on what Totalism should look like, adapted for the Colombian situation."
POLITICS_COL_GOMEZ_CASTRO_DESC:0 "Laureano Eleuterio Gómez Castro was raised by a Christian fundamentalist family and studied in a Jesuit school from a young age. After attending the 'Universidad Nacional,' he graduated as an engineer in 1909. Shortly after, Gómez founded the newspaper 'La Unidad', which he later proudly defined as 'the official voice of the priests of Colombia', and joined the Conservative Party. During the presidency of liberal Marco Fidel Suárez, he achieved notoriety for his staunch opposition to, and very aggressive condemnation of, the so-called 'incidences' he claimed were a result of social democracy. Closely tied to the interests of landowners and big corporations, he laid out plans in his publications for a society driven by a corporative system. Gómez Castro was then named ambassador to Argentina by president Pedro Nel Ospina in 1923 and was later elected as a senator in 1925. Always pushing for a more Catholic integralist agenda, Gómez Castro began working closely alongside the National Populist group Los Leopardos, whom he traveled with on a tour of Europe in order to study ways to implement their common goals for Colombia. Returning home from his tour of Europe, Gómez Castro re-initiated his campaign of denouncing democracy and eventually, he came into conflict with his own party and broke off from them in 1934, forming a new movement called Los Chulavitas. Their membership demands absolute trust in the good judgment of their leader and absolute dedication to the Catholic faith, whose values should be applied to all aspects of life."
POLITICS_COL_PINILLA_DESC:0 "Gustavo Rojas Pinilla enrolled in the military in 1920. The youngest of five brothers in a very conservative family, his father was also a military man who fought in the civil war of 1899-1903. Born in the town of Tunja, in the department of Boyacá, from an early age he developed a great interest in the life of Simon Bolívar. Pinilla’s family connections allowed him to begin his military service as a Captain however he briefly retired in 1924 in order to study engineering. Yet, with the start of the Leticia War against Peru in 1932, he re-enlisted in the military and fought in many battles. Pinilla’s bravery and valor in the field of battle earned him the ‘Orden de Boyacá’, the highest accolade in Colombia’s military. Because of an overall shortage of high commanders and because of the notoriety he developed after being given the ‘Orden de Boyacá’, he quickly climbed the ranks and was eventually promoted to the rank of Major General in 1935. Highly respected within the army, Pinilla is seen as both a great asset and a potential threat by the democratic government. He himself has admitted that if he were president, he’s sure he would make a great leader and would lead the country into a better future. In the interest of achieving this end, he has assembled a clandestine group of closely trusted officials under his command named the Movimiento de Acción Nacional. Pinilla has become convinced that he will become immortal in the memory of Colombia, much like his idol Simon Bolívar. However, whether he manages to achieve such fame remains to be seen."
POLITICS_COL_ARANGO_RAMOS_DESC:0 "Not much is known about the infancy and early years of Elíseo Arango Ramos, only that he was born in Bagadó which was at the time a small and very poor city in the department of Chocó. He studied law and founded a group of students named Los Leopardos, which sought to bring more young people to the Conservative Party and renew the nation with a new vitality based upon the principles of conservatism. From early on, he took interest in esoteric studies which his fellow Leopardos followed along with. His research led him to shape a new type of political theory based on race, traditionalism and unity which he called 'El Camino Derecho' (The Straight Path). In 1920, he invited the very popular conservative senator Gómez Castro to one of his research meetings and impressed him so much the two of them began forming a strong friendship which led them to decide to travel across Europe together in order to develop a political strategy to bring their vision of corporatism to Colombia. Above all else, Arango Ramos has been known for his fierce pride for his home department which was often ignored by the central government. This built him a reputation as he pushed for more spending for Chocó, but mostly his calls fell upon deaf ears. Gaitán and his allies are convinced this will keep happening, but Arango Ramos seeks to prove them wrong by aspiring for the presidency."

### Ideas ###
COL_political_turmoil:0 "Political Turmoil"
COL_political_turmoil_desc:0 "In a country where the two party system has always been the norm, the recent birth of minor parties led by ex-members of the Liberal and Conservative parties has moved the country’s political discourse to the extremes. Frequent episodes of violence have emerged in all of Colombia, especially in the zones furthest from the capital, where the state's grip is weakest. Many political analysts predict that at this rate we will have serious trouble to deal with in the next few years, and politically-motivated violence may become the norm."
COL_black:0 "Black Monday"
COL_black_desc:0 "Black Monday had a very harsh effect on Colombia's economy, with a large part of the population suddenly becoming jobless and losing their livelihood as companies folded almost overnight. Massive changes will be necessary to stop this economic disaster and put the country back on its feet!"
COL_black_2:0 "Recovering from Black Monday"
COL_black_2_desc:0 "The first signs of a recovery are starting to appear as Colombia’s economy seems to be turning a corner, but there is still much more work to be done if we wish to boast that we have beaten this crisis."
COL_black_over:0 "¡Adios Black Monday!"
COL_black_over_desc:0 "Finally the era of Black Monday has become a thing of the past. No one will miss these hard times and Colombia is celebrating her victory against the grim fate that at first seemed inevitable. Business seems to be returning to pre-crisis levels, and people are celebrating and chanting in the streets: 'Adios Black Monday, may you never come back'."
COL_bogotazo:0 "Political Violence"
COL_bogotazo_desc:0 "As many analysts previously correctly predicted, a spark was all it took to ignite serious riots and the nation has delved into chaos. Now, armed political groups are openly fighting in the streets and setting fire to buildings and vehicles."
COL_bogotazo_2:0 "¡Bogotazo!"
COL_bogotazo_2_desc:0 "In the awful climate of violence and destruction perpetrated by both sides of the political spectrum, the president decided to take sides and in doing so has only made the problem worse. Even if not yet declared, Colombia is now on the verge of a civil war."
COL_new_constructions:0 "Building up the Public Transport Network"
COL_new_constructions_desc:0 "Fulfilling promises to develop the capital’s public infrastructure, a new public transport system is being built in Bogotá. As a result of the massive public works project being undertaken, a large portion of government funding and resources that could’ve been used elsewhere are being diverted to bring reliable public transport to the people of Bogotá."
COL_religious_schools:0 "Religious Schools"
COL_religious_schools_desc:0 "Childrens in public schools are taught extensively about the ways of Christ and his message, but much less about history, algebra and other relevant skills for more technical careers. The next generation’s preparation for the modern job market is suffering because of this and the nation now lacks good engineers and scientists, but on the bright side we've no shortage of priests."
COL_reform_mil_academies:0 "Reformed Military Academies"
COL_reform_mil_academies_desc:0 "As Field Marshal Pinilla and other high ranking army leaders demanded, the reformation of military academies is intended to assure the loyalty of the cadets and eliminate any risk of having soldiers secretly siding with the socialists and other insurgent elements. This of course will increase the amount of time needed to train new recruits as we ensure their loyalty to the cause, but won’t really provide much in terms of extra combat readiness for our troops."
COL_airdisaster:0 "President in Hospital"
COL_airdisaster_desc:0 "The President had an accident during an Air Show in Bogotá and he is now being kept under close observation in hospital. A Temporary Council has been formed to substitute him because the vice-presidency has been abolished by a recent constitutional reform. Although the Council is trying their best to keep the public morale up and the cities safe in this difficult moment, many are seizing the opportunity to protest the legitimacy of the government and its recent policies."

### Events ###
col.1.t:0 "Colombia's Place in the World"
col.1.d:0 "Weakened by numerous civil wars (especially 1899 - 1903), the Colombian government led by Tomás Herrán was forced to acknowledge U.S. control of the Panama Canal in the Hay–Herrán Treaty of 1903. However, despite Herrán and the American government’s brokered treaty, the Colombian Congress refused to ratify the treaty. The United States in retaliation then forced the secession of Panamá from Colombia, “compensating them” with $25 million dollars paid out from 1921 to 1930. Following the end of the civil war, the conservatives took power and pursued the modernisation of the country, expanding the railroad network. Since 1850, Colombia’s main export had been tobacco, but with the turn of the century, it began to export coffee, bananas and petroleum with the aid of U.S. capital. Despite the economic growth, conflicts within the two major parties and their supporters never faded away and with the growing number of strikes and unrest, in 1928 the conservative government massacred a group of banana workers near Santa Marta. Estimates of the number of deaths ranged from 47 to as high as 2000. Public outcry ensued and the electorate was further divided. The liberals formed a government in 1930 which enacted various social and economic reforms with benefits for the various social strata. In 1933, a dispute over territory in the Amazon rainforest caused a short-lived war between Colombia and Peru which ended inconclusively."
col.1.a:0 "Whatever the future holds, we stand united."
col.29.t:0 "Black Monday is a disaster for the Colombian economy"
col.29.d:0 "With the sudden crash of the German stock market, many states including Colombia are sailing through troubled waters. Many economists predict that without rapid industrialization and a sudden shift in economic policy, the future for the Colombian people could become desperate. Many foreign investors are already fleeing the country. The world steps closer to the verge of collapse"
col.29.a:0 "We should pray for Colombia's salvation."
col.30.t:0 "Violence erupts!"
col.30.d:0 "The political discussion between Colombia’s left and right wing parties has been a staple of our country for a long time. Recently, with the devastating and inevitable crash of the Berlin Stock Exchange, the economic crisis that ensued and shook our country left our citizens enraged and in despair. More and more people are starting to feel like the Liberals and Conservatives are not representative of their interests. Many on both sides have launched attacks on the publications supporting the opposing side, setting buildings on fire and brutally killing others in their homes. This new wave of violence is currently confined to the coastal cities, but soon it could spread to our capital and other major cities in the interior. Meanwhile, although the army has been deployed to maintain order, certain elements within the army are also fanning the flames of hate against UNIR voters. People's militias are starting to organize in the countryside and in the Chocó department, where the government’s control is weakest, proclaiming their need for self-defence. Some of them are even calling for a nationwide revolution, which could result in a large-scale civil war.\nThe situation is getting increasingly desperate with every hour that passes. Should our government take a side in this matter or should we, as many of our citizens suggest, call for an early election to let the people decide?"

An enraged mob of people sympathetic to Gaitán pursued the shooter and killed him. His body disappeared and along with it, his identity and motive remain unknown. Many believe that the shooter was secretly coordinated by members of the military sympathetic to the Chulavitas movement.\nThis incident has led to massive disorder and renewed fighting in the streets. Buses have been set on fire, shops looted and destroyed, and police vehicles stolen. Chaos is everywhere.

col.25.t:0 "UNIR protests military actions with the Silent March"
col.25.d:0 "UNIR's leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán organized, along with support from the Syndicalist and Totalist factions, what has now been dubbed the \"Silent March\" across Bogotá. Approximately 100000 people, including supporters of the militias and more moderate liberals, are participating alongside the organizers, utilizing absolute silence from all of the demonstrators to denounce the recent episodes of violence that have shaken the country. Gaitán has used the march to call for an end to the government’s use of the police and military forces to repress political opposition, and invites us to confront the UNIR in a more civil and constitutional manner. Although today’s protest has thus far proceeded without incident, another protest is already scheduled for next Sunday in Manizales, with another in Bucaramanga in the works.\nDespite the current peaceful veneer Gaitán is trying to lend the protests, officials in the army are worried that the militias might eventually take them over, and that the country's security might continue to slip if left unchecked. The army is now requesting authorization to utilize force to disperse the protestors if they don’t comply with orders."

col.26.t:0 "Attempted Golpe fails"
col.26.d:0 "An attempted Coup following the recent Black Monday violence has failed. The military forces, at first coordinating under the unified intent of overthrowing the liberal government, disagreed on who should end up in power, dividing their ranks. Laureano Gómez, at first designated by the plotters to be the new president, was judged too soft by the highest ranking hardline military officials. After a few small confrontations between the army and the ever growing people’s militias in Medellín and Barranquilla, just when the golpe de estado in Bogotá was about to start, the whole ordeal was called off. Soldiers began positioning themselves, raising alarms among the public of what was happening, then, suddenly, the streets have gone silent once again. Many are blaming our army’s lack of discipline and organisation for the coup’s failure. The militias are calling for immediate action to be taken against the military leaders, in order to prevent another coup attempt from causing further chaos, but more moderate factions are calling for a dialogue to be opened with Laureano. Although he was passed over by the coup leaders, some believe he could convince the military extremists to avoid possible bloodshed."
col.26.a:0 "We need to intervene immediately! Use the syndicalist militias."
col.26.b:0 "Their points are fair. We should dialogue with Laureano and the army leaders."
col.28.t:0 "The Radical Socialists Demands"
col.28.d:0 "Our security minister, Tulio Enrique Tascón Quintero, brought us the list of UNIR demands. They ask us to once and for all deal with a number of issues that have been plaguing our nation including: tackling systemic corruption and the ability for parties to essentially purchase elections, the use of child labour, and high poverty rates. They also demand the immediate nomination of the planned economy proponent Esteban Jaramillo as economy minister and a further expansion of our welfare policies starting with the creation of new public transportation systems in the capital. The letter concluded with the signature: \"Sincerely, THE PEOPLE OF COLOMBIA\". A separate meeting to hear the demands of the other minor forces of their coalition, the Totalists and the Syndicalists, has been scheduled for next week.\n\nIn the midst of this back and forth, in Antioquia this morning coffee plantation workers began to strike. Because of the recent events, some locals are worried about the threat of a collaboration between armed Chulavita activists and policemen willing to operate outside normal measures in order to take the law into their own hands, which would likely result in a massacre similar to the one which occurred in 1928 with the bananeras.

col.27.t:0 "The Totalist and Syndicalist Demands"
col.27.d:0 "Following some delays in our meeting with the other minor parties of the left coalition, Gilberto Vieira this morning stormed the offices of El Heraldo newspaper accompanied by a large group of his Totalist followers and certain hardline Syndicalists. They demanded for the newspaper to print a list of their proposed solutions to our country's problems for the whole of Colombia and even the world to see, unless the government responds to their ultimatum. The text opens with an accusation of ineptitude by our government, due to our inability to settle the situation still ongoing in Antioquia, which they say would \"easily be resolved\" by simply accepting the demands of strikers and by answering their plea for improved working conditions. What follows is a long list of claims and grievances separated by demands coming from each faction. Chief among the claims are the Totalist's request to arm the party for self defense and the Syndicalist's request to instruct our foreign affairs with the goal of forming a closer bond with the Commune of France and all other member of the Internationale Congress. The cabinet suggests responding immediately to Vieira to avoid the publication of this potentially very dangerous paper, which could recruit more followers to their cause."

This news did not come unexpected, as we were already informed by their syndicalist party leader, Pedro Nel Gómez, about the possibility of such a proposal as a form of appeasement from the Social Democrat government of President Alfonso Pumarejo, in response to recent protests sweeping the country. Nel Gómez had already stated his intention to form closer ties with members of the Internationale and with all revolutionary countries, including ours, as a first step to an official alliance to be carried out once the unions of Colombia are strong enough to ‘expel all capitalist pigs’ and ‘bring peace to the working class people’.\n\nThe proposal concluded stating that this could be the start of a long and fruitful friendship between our great nations."

col.34.t:0 "Laureano Gómez Castro's Demands"
col.34.d:0 "Our security minister, Tulio Enrique Tascón Quintero, brought us the list of Los Chulavitas' demands. They ask us to immediately start working on a reform plan for our constitution, seeking to limit majoritarian democracy, which they suggest is subverting the political order and making the government powerless. They are instead demanding a 'mixed' system democracy, with a combination of corporate and popular rule. Accepting this change would mean members of congress would be elected through two different means: either direct popular election or as representatives of various corporate groups such as business and industrialist associations. As a second cornerstone reform, he proposes to make public education based around promoting Catholic values and vastly reducing secular education, constitutionally guaranteeing the Church's sovereignty and dominance. A separate meeting to hear the demands of the other minor forces of their coalition, the Movimiento de Acción Nacional and Los Leopardos, has been scheduled for next week.\n\nIn the midst of this back and forth, in Antioquia this morning, coffee plantation workers began to strike.

col.35.d:0 "Following some delays in our meeting with the other minor parties of the reactionary coalition, members of the army under the command of Field Marshall Gustavo Rojas Pinilla arranged a public demonstration today outside the Central Cemetery of Bogotá. They have set up a fake gravestone in front of the main gate with the engraving \"Here lies our dear and beloved Colombia, 1819 - [GetYear]\". People started gathering as Pinilla began to read his ultimatum to our government. He then invited the Leopardos' head ideologue Elíseo Arango Ramos to come forward and publicly shake hands with him. Later, we received a written and signed copy of their ultimatum. It details the demands for the establishment of a special military Emergency Force designated exclusively to deal with the socialist threat, the reformation of military academies in order to assure discipline and moral rigor within their ranks and the nomination of Carlos Cortes Vargas as security minister. This last point is maybe the most concerning one, since Vargas became infamous for his leading role in the Bananeras Massacre. His return to politics would certainly be seen as a provocation by the strikers of Antioquia. In a very delicate situation such as this it could mean fueling their rage and making the protesters more violent."

However, more extreme factions from both sides have splintered and are also running, which could throw a gear in the larger parties: mainly the socialist UNIR led by the charismatic Jorge Eliécer Gaitán and the right-wing Christian and nationalist party, referred to as Los Chulavitas, led by the strongman Laureano Gómez Castro. Sporadic violence between them has emerged. UNIR is endorsed by both the syndicalists and totalists, while Los Chulavitas are being endorsed by all anti-syndicalist factions and some sectors of the military..."

The pilot was trying to fly close to the presidential stand when he miscalculated the distance and the aircraft's wing-tip struck the stand. The president [Root.GetLeader] has been injured and urgently conducted to the hospital. Though his condition remains stable and there's no serious threat to his life, doctors have asked to monitor the president’s condition for 14 days, so he must leave his seat for some time. The constitution was modified in 1910 abolishing the vice presidency, so now a council has been formed."

What followed was a long, gruesome, and hard war where many of our great grandfathers lost their lives to assure our liberty. Every year on this day, our nation mourns their loss and remembers their heroism, especially that of Simón Bolívar, who led us through those difficult times. Celebrations of this year's anniversary were spectacular and even 130 years after the fact, public interest and civic pride are still strong, making people feel very inspired and safe."

This morning, Gaitán came into the presidential office and along with other party leaders we started discussing the details of the proposed political merger. He proclaimed that many within the Liberal Party would be vehemently in favor of his comeback and that both parties' political programs were compatible and that united, the parties stood a better chance of winning the upcoming election than if they were to remain separate. With the president’s second mandate reaching its natural end without the constitutional possibility of a third term and with no obvious popular candidate to replace Alfonso López Pumarejo, working with our former competitor now seems the most logical path to have a popular figurehead operating within the party’s umbrella to ensure victory for the party. Gaitán established a large cult of personality around himself, and the naming of him as our candidate would lead to winning back those among his supporters who supported the man more so than any of his political beliefs."
col.71.d_2:0 "A meeting was held this morning between the leader of our opposition parties, UNIR and Partido Liberal. As it turns out, Gaitán and the Liberals have been in contact for quite a while discussing in secret the possibility of forming a united opposition, in order to increase the likelihood of winning the upcoming elections. After much negotiation, the two finally reached an agreement assuring the candidacy of Gaitán as a member of the liberal party for the elections of 1946. This will of course mark the end of UNIR and while most of their supporters are expected to simply follow Gaitán, it is believed that hardliners will probably side with the Totalists led by Gilberto Vieira."

col.70.d_1:0 "Last week our annual Conservative Party conference was held in Medellín. In preparation of the upcoming 1946 elections, the members of the party held a vote to designate the party’s candidate for the presidency. Various aspirants from within the party nominated themselves for the job and espoused their vision on how to win the election and what they would accomplish as leader. In the smoky backroom discussions that unfolded as the conference went on, a consensus began emerging around party leaders that a new face should represent the Conservative Party. After some political maneuvering and a round of voting, the majority nominated colonel Efraín Rojas Acevedo, a retired Air Force commander, to be the new party leader and presidential candidate. Most felt that Acevedo's ties to a minor military branch could be seen by the electorate as a moderate alternative to the pro-army stance of Laureano Gómez Castro, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla and Elíseo Arango Ramos, while still satisfying the \"law and order\" and anti-syndicalist sentiments which resonated through the party."

The move was coordinated along with other party leaders, who decided to put their trust behind Ospina Pérez’s choice, colonel Efraín Rojas Acevedo, a retired Air Force commander. Many within the party felt that Acevedo's ties to a minor military branch could be seen by the electorate as a moderate alternative to the pro-army stance of Laureano Gómez Castro, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla and Elíseo Arango Ramos, while still satisfying  \"law and order\"  and anti-syndicalist sentiments which resonated through the party.
